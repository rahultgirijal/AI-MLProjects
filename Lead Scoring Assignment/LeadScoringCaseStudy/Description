Problem Statement:
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. 
Professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses and fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, 
then they are classified to be a lead. Company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, sales team connects with them. Through this process,
some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. 

Aim of the Case Study:
Building a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.
A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
